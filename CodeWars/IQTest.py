#   Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out
#   which one of the given numbers differs from the others. Bob observed that one number
#   usually differs from the others in evenness. Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs
#   a program that among the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and
#   return a position of this number.

#! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, which means indexes
# of the elements start from 1 (not 0)

##      Examples :
#       iq_test("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 // Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even
#       iq_test("1 2 1 1") => 2 // Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd

def iq_test(numbers):
    arr = numbers.split()
    print(arr)
    index_odd = 0
    index_even = 0
    count_even = 0
    count_odd = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if int(arr[i]) % 2 == 0:
            count_even += 1
            index_even = i + 1
        else:
            count_odd += 1
            index_odd = i + 1
    if count_even >= 2:
        return index_odd
    if count_odd >= 2:
        return index_even
    return 1

print(iq_test("1 2 2"))
print(iq_test("5 3 2"))
